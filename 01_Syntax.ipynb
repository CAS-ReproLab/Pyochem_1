    "# A Primer on Basic Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is designed for readability and efficiency, making it an ideal language for scientific computing in fields like biochemistry. Here's an overview of some basic syntax rules and concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Libraries\n",
    "- `Libraries` are collections of prepackaged code suited to specific tasks. Python is `modular`, allowing you to choose the only the functionality you need.\n",
    "- Use the `import` statement to include external libraries, essential for scientific computing.\n",
    "- Example libraries: `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Printing\n",
    "- Assign values to variables without declaring their type, thanks to Python's dynamic typing.\n",
    "- `Variables` can store different data types such as float numbers, integers, strings, and more complex data structures such as dictionaries.\n",
    "- `Variables` can start with a '_' or a letter. They cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- Use the `print()` function for outputting data. This is the simplest way to test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "- Create lists using square brackets and comma separated items `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "- Store ordered collections of items, like amino acids `[Arg, Lys, Cys]`.\n",
    "- Iterate over lists with `for` loops to perform operations on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "- Use curly braces `{}` to define `dictionaries`.\n",
    "- Store data as key-value pairs, ideal for mapping relationships, like amino acids to their properties `{A:1, B:2, C:3}`.\n",
    "- Access values by referencing their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "- Define functions using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "- Encapsulate reusable code, like calculating molecular weight of an input DNA sequence.\n",
    "- Return values using the `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy Arrays\n",
    "- Utilize `NumPy arrays` for efficient numerical computations.\n",
    "- They behave like matrices.\n",
    "- Perform operations on many values at once, or single values.\n",
    "- Arrays are useful for handling large datasets.\n",
    "- Arrays are also a useful way to encode images in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
    "- Use Matplotlib for data visualization.\n",
    "- Create plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc., to visually represent data.\n",
    "- Another plotting library worth noting is called `seaborn`, we'll talk more about that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Data Structures\n",
    "- Work with complex data structures, like nested dictionaries, for more sophisticated data modeling.\n",
    "- Store and access detailed information, such as the properties of various amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you move on..\n",
    "- In the following examples and exercises, the goal is to analyze the syntax rules as you go, rather than to explicitly lay out all the rules.\n",
    "- Don't aim to `learn python`, aim to `use python`, the learning will come with time\n",
    "- The primers in this series are meant to be short and dense, and encourage practical use of the contepts over mastering all of their possible uses\n",
    "- Focus on learning the commonalities and structure of programming over the details. When you get stuck, use foundation AI models such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to assist you (but be critical of the results and test everything).\n",
    "- Finally, all Python libraries host documenation, for example: [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html). They can also be helpful, especially for looking up arguments for specific functions.\r\n"
