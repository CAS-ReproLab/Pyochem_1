    "# Code Challenge: The pH scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to specify the degree of auto-ionization of water. Water is important in biochemistry because of its solvent properties. Molecules either dissolve well in it, or they don't, and both of those types of molecules serve important functions in cells. When the solvent properties of water change, it can have dramatic effects on the stability and behavior of biomolecules. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of pH\n",
    "\n",
    "`pH is a bulk property of water`. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ pH = -\\log_{10} [H^+] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $[H^+]$ is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (M).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation of the pH scale is based on the ionic dissociation of pure water into hydronium and hydroxide:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_2O \\leftrightarrow H^+ + OH^- $$\n",
    "\n",
    "At 25Â°C (298 K), the auto-ionization (equilibrium) constant ($K_w$) for this reaction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{M}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For neutral water at this temperature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [H^+] = [OH^-] = \\sqrt{K_w} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the pH of neutral water is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ pH = -\\log_{10} [1.0 \\times 10^{-7}] = 7.0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acidity and Basicity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acidic solutions:** Have higher $[H^+]$ and thus lower pH (pH < 7).\n",
    "- **Basic (alkaline) solutions:** Have lower $[H^+]$ and thus higher pH (pH > 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance in Biochemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enzyme Activity:** Most enzymes have an optimal pH range. Deviations from this range can alter the enzyme's structure and function.\n",
    "- **Protein Structure:** pH affects the ionization of amino acids, influencing protein structure and interactions through solubility, active site chemistry (for enzymes), and protein folding.\n",
    "- **Metabolic Processes:** Many metabolic processes are pH-dependent and are sensitive to changes in intracellular pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong acids/bases will dissociate completely and the pH can be calculated from the $k_{w}$ and the total $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$. Weak acid/base dissociation is not complete, and occurs as a `proportion` of the dissociated/undissociated forms. For weak acid/base solutions, the pH can be estimated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ pH = pKa + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $pKa$ is the acid dissociation constant, $[A^-]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base, and $[HA]$ is the concentration of the acid. The $pKa$ is a constant under specified conditions, and represents the dissociation state at which $[H^+] = [OH^-]$. In other words, the pKa is the pH at which there is a 1:1 concentration of dissociated/undissociated forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is particularly useful in biochemistry for designing buffer systems that maintain a constant pH in biological experiments. Buffers are effectively a thermodynamic `sink` for protons. \r\n"

    "$$ pH = pKa + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\right) $$\n",

    "- $[{HA}]$ is the concentration of the protonated form of the amino acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "Your task is to create a Python function that estimates the proportion of protonated amino acid molecules ${HA}]$ in a solution at a given pH and pKa. The function should also plot the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pH on the y-axis and the incremental increase in base concentration $[{A}^-]$ on the x-axis.\n",

    "   - Title: \"Protonation State of Amino Acid vs. pH\".\n",
    "   - Include a legend indicating pKa.\n",

    "### Example Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pKa_val = 4.75  # Example pKa for an amino acid\n",
