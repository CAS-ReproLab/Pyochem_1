    "## A more detailed explanation of the class definition process\n",
    "\n",
    "In class definitions, `self` is a reference to the `current instance` of the class and is used to access variables and methods that belong to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Molecule: # name the class\n",
    "    \"\"\"\" Define the attributes or data structure \"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, formula): # Initiate the class and define the inputs\n",
    "        self.name = name # 'point' the inputs to the class so you can 'call' them later\n",
    "        self.formula = formula\n",
    "    \"\"\" Define the methods or operations \"\"\"\n",
    "    def display_info(self): # Name the operation and pass the attributes to it\n",
    "        print(f\"Molecule: {self.name}\") # Define what the operation will do\n",
    "        print(f\"Formula: {self.formula}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points about `self`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance Initialization (`__init__` method)**: \n",
    "   - `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It's automatically invoked when a new instance of the class is created.\n",
    "   - `self` in `__init__` allows us to set the initial state of the object by assigning values to its properties. \n",
    "   - In the example, `self.name` and `self.formula` are instance variables that are unique to each instance of the `Molecule` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Referencing Instance Variables**:\n",
    "   - Inside other methods of the class, `self` is used to reference these instance variables.\n",
    "   - In `display_info`, `self.name` and `self.formula` are used to access the name and formula of the specific instance of `Molecule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why `self` is Necessary**:\n",
    "   - Without `self`, the class wouldn’t know which instance’s name and formula to use. This is crucial in scenarios where you have multiple instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Passing `self` to Methods**:\n",
    "   - When you call a method on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. This argument is what we refer to as `self`.\n",
    "   - For example, when you create a `Molecule` object and call `display_info`, you don’t need to pass the instance explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "water = Molecule(\"Water\", \"H2O\")\n",
    "water.display_info()  # Automatically passes `water` as `self` to `display_info`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, when `display_info` is called on the `water` instance, `self` in `display_info` refers to `water`. Thus, `self.name` and `self.formula` will access the name and formula of `water`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I imagine this is all a bit confusing.. methods, attributes, 'instances'... It took me awhile to get my head around these things too. Let's expand the usefulness of our molecule class to see if that clarifies things a bit.."

    "## Giving the Molecule Class a More Useful Function\n",
    "Now that we've done something simple to illustrate the class concept, let's do something that's actually useful. Define a function to give the `molecule` class the ability to calculate the `molecular weight` from an input chemical formula. To keep it simple for now, we won't allow a comprehensive list of inputs, just a few common atoms found in organic molecules. \n",
