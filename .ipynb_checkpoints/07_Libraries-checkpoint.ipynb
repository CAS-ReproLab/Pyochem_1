    "# A Primer on Python Libraries and Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python libraries and frameworks are essential tools that provide pre-written code to help with specific tasks or types of work. Note that libraries have `dependencies` and may require other packages to be installed. Installation information can be cound on the support websites for each library. For typical scientific computing libraries, installation and dependencies are pretty straightforward (e.g., numpy, pandas, etc). For others, resolving dependencies can be fairly confusing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Environments\n",
    "- **Definition**: An `environment` is a separate set of folders that you can install a specific version of python in along with all its dependencies.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This practice is essential for protecting the `base python install` that your operating systems uses for stuff and also serves as a way to have a standalone python ecosystem that can be tailored to specific versions that you might need for compatibility.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Using the Anaconda navigator add an environment called my_env. It's pretty intuitive, but here are some [additional instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/). If something goes wrong, you can simply remove it and start fresh. `I strongly recommend not using your 'base' environment` for your python programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "- **Definition**: A library in Python is a collection of modules and packages that offer pre-written code to perform common tasks.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Libraries are used to extend the functionality of Python, allowing for code reuse and modular programming.\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "  - `numpy` for numerical operations.\n",
    "  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "  - `matplotlib` for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frameworks\n",
    "- **Definition**: A framework is a collection of libraries and pre-written code that provides a foundation structure for developing specific types of applications.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Frameworks dictate the flow of control in applications and provide generic functionalities, which users can extend or override. `For typical scientific computing, you won't need to worry about frameworks`. \n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - `Django` and `Flask` for web development.\n",
    "  - `PyQT` for user graphic user interfaces (GUIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences between libraries and frameworks\n",
    "- **Control Flow**: In a library, the control flow is dictated by the programmer. In a framework, the control flow is dictated by the framework (Inversion of Control).\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Libraries are used when you need specific functionalities or utilities, whereas frameworks are used as a foundation for building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration\n",
    "- **Complementing Each Other**: Libraries can be used within frameworks to enhance the functionality of applications.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Python's ecosystem allows for seamless integration between different libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for various types of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- Libraries and frameworks in Python significantly reduce development time and effort by providing reusable code and other features.\n",
    "- For scientific computing, understanding the concept of libraries is important, you will have to import tools nearly every time you write a python program.\n",
    "- The most useful libraries to be familiar with at this point are: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). alysis, and web development.\r\n"
