# Pyochem_1
Learn fundamentals of scientific computing for biochemistry using Python in Jupyter Notebooks

## What to Expect: 
- **.ipynb files**: Each of the files represents a key concept. It consists of a brief explanation, followed by code examples. There are exercises with solutions that follow.
- **How to practice**: Read the explanations and examples, pay attention to the syntax. Do the exercises while `peeking` at the examples and solutions as needed. Don't copy/paste solutions. This will result in useable code, but you won't learn anything.  
- **Comment excessively**: add lots of comments to your exercise solutions to explain what everything does. If you're not sure, use web search and ChatGPT for assistance.
- **Building a reference**: These files serve as an introduction, but also as a reference to return to in the future when you need to use a specific concept, but may not remember how to use it correctly. 

## Contents:
1. **Syntax**: basic syntax for creating and storing variables
2. **Data Types**: basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries
3. **Control Flow**: learn to put the computer to work with loops and logic
4. **Functions**: make reusable code using functions
5. **Code Challenge**: synthesize the key concepts learned so far by exploring the pH scale
6. **Libraries**: take advantage of the many libraries and frameworks available for Python
7. **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: combine data structures and operations into one object
8. **DataFrames**: a special data structure that is useful for large multivariate datasets
9. **Error Handling**: learn to interactively check and ignore issues your code may encounter
10. **File IO**: open, process, and write .csv files for basic data science
11. **Simulation**: use the power of generating functions to create model datasets to visualize and improve your hypotheses

## How to use the .ipynb files:
- **Note**: All of the following information pertains to Microsoft Windows PCs. I have not tested any of this on a Mac or tablet. The notebooks may be run in Google Colab, but the file input/output process will be different, and some of the dependencies will need to be installed.
- **Anaconda**: I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and using the [Anaconda navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/index.html) to set up your environment.
- **Dependencies**: You will need to install numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn. This can be done in anaconda navigator. 
- **JupyterLab V. Jupyter Notebook**: I prefer Jupyterlab, which can be installed and launched in the Anaconda navigator. It has more features than Jupyter Notebook, and can be set to `dark theme` in the settings. 
- **Directories**: I recommend setting up a folder on your desktop, and downloading the .ipynb files from this repository into it. Once you have launched JupyterLab, navigate to the folder and open/modify the files as needed.

## What's next?:
- **Pyochem_2**: I will follow up with a second repository soon. This repository will focus on using these fundamental skills to do computing tasks that are more representative of scientific computing in the 'real world' including:
  1. Simulate molecular dynamics
  2. Integrate with PyMol for structural analysis
  3. More sophisticated calculator workflows with additional GUI implementation
  4. Descriptive statistics and plotting for large datasets
  5. Regression analysis on biochemical data
  6. Basic image analysis
  7. More sophisticated simulation tasks
  8. Basic machine learning models
