# Pyochem_1
- Learn fundamentals of scientific computing for biochemistry using Jupyter notebooks in Python

## Contents
- **Syntax**: basic syntax for creating and storing variables
- **Data Types**: basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries
- **Control Flow**: learn to put the computer to work with loops and logic
- **Functions**: make reusable code using functions
- **Code Challenge**: synthesize the key concepts learned so far by exploring the pH scale
- **Libraries**: take advantage of the many libraries and frameworks available for Python
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: combine data structures and operations into one object
- **DataFrames**: a special data structure that is useful for large multivariate datasets
- **Error Handling**: learn to interactively check and ignore issues your code may encounter
- **File IO**: open, process, and write .csv files for basic data science
- **Simulation**: use the power of generating functions to create model datasets to improve your hypotheses

## How to use these files
- **Anaconda**: I recommend downloading Anaconda
